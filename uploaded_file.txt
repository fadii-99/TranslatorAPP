Common Commercial Lease Agreements
•	Net Lease : A net lease is when you are responsible for paying the base rent as well as the utilities, maintenance, and insurance. This popular commercial lease is broken up into even more distinct categories:
o	Single net lease : Although not very common, single net leases are the most straightforward net leases. As a tenant, you are responsible for paying the rent and property taxes of the space.
o	Double net lease : You are responsible for paying the rent, property taxes, and building insurance. The landlord must pay the costs of utilities, maintenance, and any other expenses that may arise. This type of lease is common for multi-tenanted buildings since the property owner is financially responsible for structural issues. The amount you pay will vary based on how much square footage you are leasing.
o	Triple net lease : With this kind of lease, property can have big advantages. As a tenant, you are responsible for most of the costs relating to your occupation of a commercial space. You pay for rent, maintenance, insurance, taxes, utilities, and standard property repairs. Proceed with caution when deciding if you want a triple net lease, as you could be responsible for high expenses, like a broken HVAC or leaky roof. The advantage is that the base rent for these properties tends to be lower.
o	Bondable net leases: This lease is close to a triple net lease, but you have even more stakes in your rental space since the tenant cannot terminate the lease even if the property becomes unusable. You are responsible for any risks associated with the commercial space, such as natural disasters or fires. These types of leases are quite rare, although the benefit for tenants is that the landlord has fewer termination rights.
•	Gross Lease : These are the two types of gross leases you may see as a commercial property tenant:
o	Full-service gross lease: You pay a fixed rent payment every month. As a business owner, this is the easiest rent to budget for since you can expect to pay the same flat rate each month. Your landlord is responsible for all other expenses, including insurance, utilities, taxes, and property management fees.
o	Modified gross lease : With this lease, the landlord is still responsible for insurance, utilities, taxes, and property management fees. Along with paying your fixed rent each month, you are also responsible for any incremental increases in operating costs. For instance, if the property taxes of the building suddenly increase, you may have to pay for a portion of that increase.
•	Percentage Lease : Restaurants and retailers are the businesses who are more likely to sign percentage leases. Generally, you see them used with businesses that have varying sales volumes, since the rent adjusts to their revenues. Percentage leases are when you pay the base rent and a percentage of your business's gross income. Before signing the lease, you and the landlord will agree upon a set percentage. The more your business makes, the more you will pay to your landlord (although the percentage will stay the same). This type of lease helps the business owner and property owner work together to increase the business's profits. This is a smart lease to choose if you want help with promotion efforts.
